## Overview


The Cook is one of the most simple roles on the station: Make food, serve it to customers, and say no to the [Chaplain](Chaplain.md) when they ask you to give them a knife for "[ritualistic purposes](Battle-royale.md)". Its usually recommended for new players to try the game with this role if they are on their own.


### Dinner's ready


Being a Cook is a relatively simple job. You have one duty: make sure the station doesn't starve. You have two ways of doing this: cooking raw steaks in the microwave, or [botany](Botanist.md) actually knowing how their job works. As for the meat steaks, you can either go to the Butcher's room (in outpoststation it's the room north of the kitchen, just head into the maintenance tunnels above you and the room will be on the other side), or by bugging [Medical](Medical-Doctor.md) for bodies once they've cloned said bodies. As for Botany, food preparation outside of just making steaks doesn't exist yet, so for now you can just ask them to hand you some crops so you can do your job without there being any meat on the station.

To make a steak you must just take the meat, put it in a microwave, wait 10 seconds and serve. How does the microwave magically add a plate to the steak? Nobody knows, but we do know that those plates are pretty good for abusing the clown.
