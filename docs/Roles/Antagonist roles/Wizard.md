Role type:  <font color= "#711e25">Antagonist</font>. Access levels: <font color="#711e25">anywhere they can teleport to</font>, Difficulty: <font color="Red">hard</font>.

Space Wizards are a unique antagonist who has access to magical powers that defy scientific principles. Most are part of the Space Wizard Federation, a mysterious organization that is at war with NanoTrasen. The source of the wizard's power is their spellbook, which they consult to master a variety of spells to cast to cause chaos and devastation.

As the wizard, you will be given quite a few objectives (typically 4) to complete that will require you to steal high-risk items and assassinate crew members. Even as an almighty wizard, master of time and space, you are ultimately just as squishy and vulnerable as any other person. So, if you are to complete your objectives and survive to the end of the round, you will still have to high degree of cleverness to get the job done.

**Understand that the Wizard is a work-in-progress antagonist, and does not have all of their abilties in game yet.**
