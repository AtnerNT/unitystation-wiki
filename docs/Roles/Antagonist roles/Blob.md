### Networked Fibers

The overmind has decided to micromanage everything

Can only expand manually (by clicking). can only expand next to core. manual expansion near your core moves the core to that tile. Core regenerates health 2.5 times faster than other chemical types. Nodes and core produce extra resources intend of producing blob tiles  Remember you can alt+click on a blob tiles to remove it, incase you get stuck
