# THE ADMIN

Admins are weird spacial creatures that seem to exist all over the multiverse excerting incredible power over things for at times seemingly no reason at all.
It is guessed that NAR-SIE and other gods are admins.

# HOW TO ADMIN

If you're the type of admin to just immediately freeze and jail someone without any research or question first.
Barring situations where they, for example, have released plasma all over the station and have already killed over 8 people as a non antag.

Or if you are an admin that is okay going back and forth between you and a player in a slinging match:

SCREW OFF.

YOU ARE NOT MEANT TO BE AN ADMIN

# Now how to really admin:

Adminning is and can be pretty damn difficult, but it doesn't have to be.

Remember, as an admin you are the voice of reason in all things. If you act out and act silly not only will you make yourself look bad you will just make any situation worse.
Admins are here to solve issues, not create or extend them. 
In time with that just jailing someone and bringing them out the game is not only harmful to the game, it also victimises that person and makes them defensive.



Here is my personal rules for adminning, you may keep these and i'd be quite proud if you thought they were reasonable and good. 
Though they arent and cant be perfect for all situations.

- If a player has broken what I consider a minor rule, for example if a player does something bad, I'll say something like:

"Hey P, I noticed you are doing a bit of a bad. See.. You're not allowed to do X on this server, It's actually against our rules. Any chance you can stop?"

> Players have lots of responces to this but look at the language.
You're doing a bit of a bad. (This is entirely non-combative, and even joke-y)
See... You're actually not allowed to do X on this server, It's actually against our rules. Any chance you can stop?
Explains the reason without (I hope) coming across as rude or combative. But it's also a ending statement meaning refuting it is a negative.
It does however, leave the statement open allowing the player to respond and ask what they did specifically or what rule they broke.

ENDING STATEMENTS is the gold standard.
Whilst used incorrectly ending statements can make you entirely combative and even rude, using it properly is the easiest way to end something before it becomes bigger.



There are lots of ways a player can talk to you, one stands out:

Rules Lawyer "Actually, rule X states that X is ok. I am not breaking anything here.":
Not incredibly common but the easiest way is to respond like this:

"Ok, Well that's nice and all but I am an admin. 
And I do actually know the rules, and whilst you can quote what you like...
You've still broken them. 
And it's not always the literal definition of the rules, but its the spirit of them too... So i can see how you're a little confused.
The rules are generally a guideline only, anything else is up to the admins to figure out. within reason."

> Never leave something on a combative ending statement.

TWO paths to end that statement:

1

>if you're willing to stop, I'm actually comfortable leaving this as is and just letting you play on.
(If you are going to put a note on the players id, never state it.)
(This is an open ended statement, although it automatically recommends two answers: YES/NO )
If it's a no:
Whatever you say here, act as if you've tried and are disappointed. It's the best practice.
"Well, I can't say i didnt try to convince you. If you really wont at all I'm really forced to interfere and just stop it.
Though that's not to say I'm infallible, if you really still think im in the wrong, I'll link you the forums so you can report it:LINK"
(Tempban is going to be the recommended one here.)

>so I'm sorry but thats just how it is. Whilst I normally give people the chance to just play on, change, and have fun,
you've really gone a bit too far here. If it was within reason I'd even give you a chance to apologise and forget it etc.
but the problem is you've really pushed it. I'll go ahead and link you the forum so you can appeal, but for now it's goodbye.

Note: And i'll show it in big text:

#LINK THE APPEAL or the FORUM

Our little game is and has always been (At this time, maby we're the next netflix?? 10/2020) small. Our community is small. Whatever happens,
giving someone a bad experience playing the game is only going to make it less fun to play in the future.
Admins that just act combative and end statements in a hostile or combative manner are literally the bane of this game, I expect more damage has been done
by those types of admins than any mechanic or gameplay element of the game that people don't like.

Generally, the game works better without an admin. That's actually a fact. Players are people. People know how to generally act fine.

MRP and LRP are in some cases very similiar. MRP and LRP servers generally require little to no adminning AT ALL.

MRP can only require a little if the person generally isnt playing, like ignoring their job entirely as engineering and ignoring the Engine.
If someone is in this situation and replies they dont know how to fix it or set it up consider teaching them how.
If someone states that they just arent willing to do anything like that, consider nudging them along:

"I'm sorry, but you selected an engineer... It's a MRP server and in MRP you're really supposed to do your job. If you don't want to do it, i can respawn you as something else?"

HRP is the only server type that needs admins for the day-to-day running. As it's required to filter out the people that come from LRP to just play LRP on HRP.

It's a small guide with a little advice, if anyone wants to add some to it or perhaps disagree with the advice, suggest an edit! 
You could have a better way to handle the situations toom i could be being silly here, i don't think i am though.
