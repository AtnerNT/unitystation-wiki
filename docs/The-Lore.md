# The Lore

## General=
A long time ago, humanity discovered plasma, a clean burning and efficient source of fuel. Nanotrasen, one of the first companies to find it, built a monopoly based on plasma mining and became a major influencer over entire governments. Plasma allowed for a new age of exploration, science and conquest, during which vast leaps were made and many planets were conquered. However, as sources of plasma were depleted faster than new ones were found, exploration slowed and decay set in. Many pinned their hopes on bluespace, which promised to be a perfectly clean way to both move about and power entire cites. This worried nanotrasen, and they sought to gain a monopoly on bluespace, constructing many labs and stations to find its properties and find new uses for both it and plasma. One particular earth based lab was experimenting with a particularly large and pure bluespace crystal, the purest sample yet, and accidentally ripped a hole into space time which partially ripped apart earth, leaving a new asteroid belt and a lava covered husk in its place, populated by whatever crawled through the rip . Nanotrasen, already owning a monopoly on plasma, took advantage of this, setting up more stations to mine plasma and bluespace from the belt, making it grow even larger. Fearing the power nanotrasen would have if it also gained a monopoly on bluespace, a conglomerate of mega-corporations set up the syndicate, a mercenary group with access to the finest firepower available. Ontop of this, many gods from beyond our dimension see the weakened fabric around earth as an opportunity. This leaves you, a crewmember aboard SS13, a station designed to mine and process both plasma and bluespace, and find new applications for them, the crown jewel of nanotrasen, set up exactly on the point where the fabric of space is at its weakest and in a dense field of asteroids where pirates and nuclear commandos can easily hide. have fun.
