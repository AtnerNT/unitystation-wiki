If you are new to the game, check the [how not to die instantly](How-not-to-die-instantly.md) guide.  

UnityStation is a free to play game made as a clone to the [Space Station 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URJ_qSXruW0) game, but built on Unity, instead of using the outdated [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/).  

Space Station 13, the greatest spessmen simulator ever created. If you have ever played SS13 before you can agree on one thing, [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/), it sucks! This is where UnityStation comes in. Started in Nov 2016 we have endeavored to ensure SS13 has a long and prosperous future outside of [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/) by cloning the [/TG/](https://tgstation13.org/) source to Unity.

> A lot of work has been completed since its humble beginnings in 2016 and we have just released our first public alpha release on our version of the [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/) hub called the Station Hub. The project has a growing and dedicated community of contributors who are eager to see this thing become a reality. Best of all it is all open source and available on GitHub.

Probably [Doobly](Doobly.md), 2018.

In this game, you pick from a variety of [roles](Roles.md) on different [maps](Maps.md) to keep the station running:

[![Command](Command.png)](Roles/Command.md) [![Security](Security.png)](Roles/Security.md) [![Engineering](Engineering.png)](Roles/Engineering.md) [![Medical](Medical.png)](Roles/Medical.md) [![Research](Research.png)](Roles/Research.md) [![Supply](Supply.png)](Roles/Supply.md)

[![Service](Service.png)](Roles/Service.md) [![Civilian](Civilian.png)](Roles/Civilian.md) [![Artificials](Artificials.png)](Roles/Artificials.md) [![Antagonists](Antagonists.png)](Roles/Antag.md) [![Special](Special.png)](Roles/Special.md) [![Admin](Admin.png)](Roles/Admin.md)

Or you can try attacking it and maby nuking it to [ashes](antags/Nuclear-Emergency.md):

Traitor,Changeling,Wizard,Cultist,NukeOps,Blob,Alien,Spider

You can also become various difference races although some may be disabled on certain servers and some to be added:

[![Human](Human.png)](Races/Human),[![Saurian](Saurian.png)](Races/Saurian),[![Plasmamen](Plasmamen.png)](Races/Plasmamen),[![Goople](Goople.png)](Races/Goople),[![Lepidops](Lepidops.png)](Races/Lepidops),[![Lithoid](Lithoid.png)](Races/Lithoid)

[![Nanos](Nano.png)](Races/NaniteFolk),[![Slug](Slug.png)](Races/Slug),[![Wooloo](Sheeple.png)](Races/Sheeple),[![Polygeri](Polygeri.png)](Races/Polygeri),[![Podpeople](Pod.png)](Races/Pod),[![Ave](Ave.png)](Races/Ave)

But the most important factor, you don't need to be an antagonist to start shooting people in the face, because of this thing, freedom. 
However, you are bound by the individual server [rules](https://sites.google.com/view/unitystation-server-rules/server-rules) of playing, so even if you really want to shoot that clown in the face with your gun, you must first have a really [good reason.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs6V2oHvwXw) Like the clown tried to kill you or [something.](https://sites.google.com/view/unitystation-server-rules/server-rules)

>Servers are branched into different levels of roleplay, It is my hope that servers will have separate and clear rules for LRP, MRP and HRP respectively. With clear rules on what is acceptable and in what situation its easier for everyone to be on the same page. Sadly it is a plague in ss13 that rules are often used by badmins to hide behind for irregular enforcement of them. We can all move past this and onto a version of enforcement where the admin researches first and is sure a rule has been broken before it even gets to contacting the [player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP1I4r-e760) and interrupting the [game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE37AOPX9VI)

The game itself is a chaos machine, some times rounds can take 2 minutes. Usually if the wizard suicides into security. Otherwise it can be a 30 minute long [Royale](Battle-royale.md) and others it can be a multiple hour long phoenix wright court simulator or even cult wasteland as the chaplain holds the line against the onslaught. It depends partly on what the server it is and what [random](antags.md) thing happens.
