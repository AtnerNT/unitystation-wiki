If you are absolutely new to this game, check the [how not to die instantly](How-not-to-die-instantly.md) guide.  

UnityStation is a free to play game made as a clone to the Space Station 13 game, but built on Unity, instead of using the clunky design of [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/).  

Space Station 13, the greatest clown simulator ever created, or atmos simulator? Who knows, but if you have ever played SS13 before you can agree on one thing which is that [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/) sucks! This is where UnityStation comes in. Started in November 2016 unitystation has endeavored to ensure SS13 has a long and prosperous future outside of [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/) by cloning the [/TG/](https://tgstation13.org/) source to Unity. 

> A lot of work has been completed since its humble beginnings in 2016 and we have just released our first public alpha release on our version of the [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/) hub called the Station Hub. The project has a growing and dedicated community of contributors who are eager to see this thing become a reality. Best of all it is all open source and available on GitHub.

Probably [Doobly](Doobly.md), 2018.

In this game, you pick from a variety of [roles](Roles.md) to keep the station running, or you can be an antagonist and try burning it to ashes (or [nuking it](antags/Nuclear-Emergency.md), whatever). But the most important factor, you don't need to be an antagonist to start shooting people in the face, because of this thing, freedom. However, you technically are bound by the [rules](https://sites.google.com/view/unitystation-server-rules/server-rules) of role playing, so even if you really want to shoot that clown in the face with your gun, you must first make a scene of how he betrayed you and never told you about the dark side of the force (so yeah, a bother).

The game itself is a chaos machine, sometimes its a 30 minutes long [battle royale](Battle-royale.md) and others is a 2 hours long Phoenix Wright court simulator with heavy usage of [space law enforcement](Security.md), but most of the time you are just trapped in a room and never able to break free or just thrown into space for no reason at all.

Anyway, since this wiki is awfully incomplete, you should add your own stuff to it. [Get to work](So-close-to-impossible-that-it-might-as-well-not-even-exist.md) u moron, and learn the [Space Law](Space-Law.md).
