# Antagonist
Antagonists are roles or sub-roles added to the game for the tension factor. However, a round won't always have antagonists. Some rounds will have no actual antagonists, and the round will rely entirely on Dick Bob McGee the \[assistant](assistant) finding his way into Atmospherics and starting a plasma fire himself.

Currently, only three antagonist types are in the game: [[Nuke Ops]], \[Traitor](Traitor), and \[Cargonia](Cargonia). However, assuming UnityStation will be a complete remake of [[/TG/]], more \[antags](RP words and abbreviations), such as Changeling, Blob, Revolution, Xenomorph (playable xenos, not NPCs like the ones on asteroids) etc. \[may](So close to impossible that it might as well not even exist) be added in future updates.

Antagonists are often give objectives, these can range from stealing a plasma can to hijacking the escape shuttle. Some antagonists (namely those who dont have to work together) are able to ignore objectives and instead go do whatever they wish. This does not apply however with antagonists such as xenomorphs or revolutionaries, who MUST try to fulfill objectives, or at the very least not hinder the team effort.
