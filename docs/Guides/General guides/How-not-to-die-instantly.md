# How not to die instantly

## Back to Basics

Unitystation, like it's predecessor Space Station 13, has an incredibly large learning curve. Death early on will force you into a ghost state where you watch over the round until someone clones you. But unlike Space Station 13, you can't respawn in anyway. If your new to Unitystation here is a small list for you so you can not die instantly. 


### How not to die instantly


1) To not die you need to know the controls - W A S D for walking and mouse for interacting, see [intents](Intents.md) to find out how to interact with things and beings.


2) Learn to do your role, to do so look on the bottom of the [main page](Main-page.md), it contains a guide on (almost) every role in the game.


3) Don't do crimes, unless you want to be brigged, and possibility abused, learn the [[Space Law]] if you didn't know it already.


4) If the door you try to open flashed yellow you probably should not go through it, because it's depressurized on the other side.


5) If you do need to walk through that door then get a heavy duty suit and preferably mag boots, and an oxygen supply, that 
requires a mask and a oxygen tank in your hot bar, to enable the supply click the icon on the right.


6) If you get spaced (the act of being thrown out into space by pressure) throw anything and everything you can in the direction you're flying, that will hopefully, make you fly the other way, you're still going to die, but you're more likely to be found by your crew mates.


7) If there is a Xenomorph invasion, or [Syndies](Nuclear-emergency.md) on board:



a) If you are armed and robust, go at em, but be careful and never be alone.


b) If you are not armed or not robust then run away, cower behind sec and hide in a locker.


8) Eat. Food can be found at the cafeteria, if food cannot be found then find a knife hunt some prey and butcher it, the meat can then be used for a variety of [foods](Cooking.md).


9) Learn to [build](Construction.md) in case you need to.


10) Most flying items can and will kill you, no matter how harmless they may appear.


11) You should try to keep a tool-stacked tool-belt, med-kit, a light and some food, I prefer six cutlets, but to each their own, on your person at all times.



12) You are expected to know how to role play to a certain extent, use these [role play abbreviations](Rp-words-and-abbreviations.md).


13) If you're a [traitor](Traitor.md), you are allowed to get away with many war crimes, but try to only make life hell for your target, please.


14) If you're a [security officer](Security.md), please don't make power plays, it ruins the other's experience and gives you temporary euphoria, with regret afterwards.


15) If you're injured you should go to medical or treat yourself.



(Being 'robust' is being acquainted with the combat system enough, a guide on which can be found [here](Combat.md). How much is enough you ask? Well there's no real measure.)
