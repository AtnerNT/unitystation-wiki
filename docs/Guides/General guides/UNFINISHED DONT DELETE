# The (Revised) Guide to Combat

## Introduction
Combat in Unitystation is both very complex and unique. While the base upon which it is built on is itself rather intricate, the myriad of interacting mechanics introduced by other systems
increases its complexity exponentially. This, aswell as the social element, lends itself well to making combat in unitystation more tactically unique.
Unfortunately (or fortunately?) this makes combat in unitystation very difficult to master. While this guide will by no means cover all the details (wed be here all week), it should
introduce and teach the core combat system, aswell as provide practical advice for combat and how to work towards a better understanding.

# Core systems
The very core of the combat system is a combination of parts of the [intent](Intents.md) and health systems. [Intents](Intents.md) are important to learn to interact with the combat system, and health is good
to know to reduce how often you die, and allow you to more effectively choose targets.

## Intents
There are 4 [intents](Intents.md). Help, grab, disarm and harm

### Help (green)
Help intent, as implied by the name, is mainly used for non-combat interactions. It is still useful to know. If you on help intent, and not carrying a weapon in your hands, 
you cannot injure others, and will swap places/pass those you run into rather than stopping (good for chasing someone or being on the run). Using help intent on someone (including yourself) with medecine
in hand will apply the medecine to a selected body part, healing it (assuming you apply the correct meds).

### Grab (yellow)
Grab intent will grab the person you use it on. By moving, they can break out of your grab. When someone is grabbed, and not resisting, you can pull them, much the same as ctrl + click.
If someone is handcuffed, they will be unable to break out of your grab, letting you pull them into a prison cell if your merciful, or into a discrete location if your not.

### Disarm (blue)
Dont let the name fool you, disarm plays a far bigger role than just wrenching a weapon out of someones hands. If used on another player, they have a very good chance to drop their weapon, 
which you can then pick up, and possibly use (note, some guns are locked by id-based firing pins). If you absolutely must fight someone who is equipped, and are unarmed, DONT use the harm intent.
use the disarm intent and use their own weapons against them. This also works in reverse, dont get in melee range if you have a gun, as you will likely get disarmed and lit up with
your own gun. While you cant avoid getting in melee range if your using a melee weapon, you can minimize the risk of being disarmed by spending as little time in melee range as possible (in open combat)
and instead using Hit-and-Retreat methods, or by surprising/ambushing your foe to (hopefully) chop them up before they react.

Disarm doesnt stop there, though. Each individual disarm has a small chance to knock over the person being disarmed. While knocked down, people are stunned, and cannot shoot or melee back against attacks.
The time given by a disarm knockdown is NOT enough to handcuff people, dont make the mistake of coming close to an angry man with a gun with only one free hand of your own. When someone is knocked down, if
you are very quick, you can loot a few items from them. This can be anything on their person, from backpacks, to hidden guns, to their ID. If you plan on doing this to get your hands on a juicy ID or
traitor objective, be sure you know where they are probably located in the persons inventory. 

### Harm (red)
Harm intent, as is obvious from the name, is used to injure others with raw brute force. If you are on harm intent, you will attempt to hit those you click on in melee range (even if holding a gun!)
with the weapon in hand. Weapons can all still be used in other intents, and harm is mostly an intent there to make sure you dont accidentally help someone. While in harm, you wont be able
to apply medicine, help others up, etc. clicking someone while in harm intent with an empty hand will punch them, dealing a moderate amount of damage, but not enough to fight off a person who
has a proper weapon.

## The health system
In unitystation, health is much more complex than in most games. health can be decreased directly by 4 types of damage, two of which are applied to individual limbs. The total health is the base health, minus damage dealt to limbs,
and minus damage dealt by other causes. This means that enough damage to a single limb can kill, even if it is the only limb damaged. 

### Damage types
Brute damage is dealt by ballistic weapons, most melee weapons, and punches. It can be healed with bandages, and is applied to individual limbs. Burn damage is similarly applied to individual limbs. it can be
healed with ointment, and is dealt by lasers and fires. oxygen damage is caused by being in critical condition, or by a lack of air. It can be slowed with CPR (help intent on downed critical person) and is best healed
by getting somewhere one can breathe, or by healing to take a person out of a critical state. Toxin/poision damage is caused mainly by toxins, and is harder to heal than other damage types, requiring specific
chemicals to fix. 

### Limb targetting
On your hud, there is a small doll. when bodyparts are clicked, they will be targeted. this allows you to heal or injure specific regions. different parts have different chances to be successfully
hit (head is harder to hit than the torso for example). If an attack misses, it will most likely instead connect with another bodypart, only rarely will you whiff an attack entirely. The more injured you are,
the more likely you are to miss. These body parts will also be targeted when firing a gun.

## Various maladies
Especilly worthile to note are the many situational effects and objects that play large roles in combat.

### Stuns
Players can be stunned in several ways. Disarms can disable them for a short period, as can tazers, while stun batons can knock someone to the ground for a long enough period to arrest them.
It should be noted, again, that tazers and disarms will not give you enough time to fill the handcuff progress bar before the person your arresting gets back up. Stunned players can
be looted by dragging their sprite onto your own, as can handcuffed people.

### Handcuffs 
Handcuffs can be applied at any time, but require time to put on. This means you cant just approach a man with a knife and cuff him, not without disabling him first. one of the
few reliable methods to get this time is the stun baton, which can knock someone to the ground long enough to let you handcuff them. Those in cuffs cannot harm, punch, pick up objects,
or resist grabs, meaning they can be safely moved to a different location. Keep in mind they can still talk on the radio, unless you take that too.

### Blindness
While more rare, temporary blindness can be inflicted by flashbangs and portable flashes. While blind you can interact and run around, but cannot see. Frankly, blind people are incredibly
unpredictable, so blinding someone will probably make it harder, not easier, to land a stun on them.

# Weapons
There is a very large amount of weapons in unitystation, and learning which weapons are best for which jobs is good for maximizing effectiveness

## firearms
Most firearms shoot either lasers or bullets. Lasers can pass through windows and deal mainly burn damage, while guns deal brute damage.

### Lasers
Laser weapons only have a few set types of bolts, only two of which are very common. Tazer/electric bolts stun players on impact for a short period, disabler bolts stun them for
what is basically no time at all, "kill" lasers deal a moderate amount of burn damage, and disruptor bolts deal ridiculous amounts of damage capeable of melting walls. Laser and
energy based weapons like them must be charged at charging stations, with very few exceptions.

### bullets
There is a very large variety in ammunition in US, hell, almost every gun takes a different type of bullet. many of these bullets can also come in augmented forms, such as AP, hollow point,
incindiary, and more. Guns clips must be ejected when the gun is empty by clicking the gun in hand, and must be loaded by clicking on the gun while holding a magazine. Bullets are typically
more damaging than lasers, but the requirment of carrying around clips and lack of rapid adaptability means lasers still compete well.

### Fully automatic weapons
Full auto weapons, such as smgs and machine guns, will continue firing for as long as you hold down the mouse. While capeable of rapidly killing people, they burn through ammo equally
fast, and thus must be reloaded often. they are also rather inaccurate. Per-shot, they typically deal less damage than other weapons. They are great at mowing down single targets if you have plenty of down-time to reload
and prepare, and are great at killing those you are chasing, but struggle in more extended fights, when there is little opportunity to recover, and struggle at long range, forcing you close to danger.. 

### Semi automatic weapons
These fire once when you press the mouse button, are typically higher damage per shot, and are rather accurate. This means you can kill people without placing yourself in too much danger, and conserve
ammunition. semi-auto weapons that can fire with little cooldown are equally effective in ambushes as automatic weapons, but those with longer cooldowns (such as rifles and lasers) struggle to kill people before
they can flee. One exception to this is the sniper, which has a large cooldown but is great in ambushes, simply due to its massive damage per shot. Seni auto weapons cant mow people down
as fast as full auto weapons, but let you be safer and conserve ammunition.

## melee weapons
Melee weapons are inherantly far riskier than ranged ones, but can greatly reward the risk if utilized smartly. Unlike guns, most melee weapons (with few exceptions) follow
the same simple point and stab interface. How you use a melee weapon can however change depending on just how effective and rare it is.

### Low effectiveness/improvised/punches
Improvised weapons (chairs, fire extinguishers, etc) are far less effective than other melee weapons, but their accessability means they are often all you have. When using these,
you can rush down and take more chances to be disarmed than someone using a more potent weapon, as you can simply grab another if you lose yours. This means your best off moving side to side
facing a target, bashing on them repetedly, or trading disarms (especilly if you are unarmed). These weapons should not be used to try and assassinate someone, as theyll more than likely run off, but they
are great for self defence.

### High effectiveness melee weapons
Purpouse made melee weapons, such as eswords and sabers, are rarer, but a lot more devestating. their main weakness is less their own, and more because they can be disarmed and
used against you, and you cant easily get another one. Therefore, when you have one of these, you want to minimize how much time they can disarm you. This can be done either by
chopping them up before they can react in an ambush, or by only taking short periods to attack. Rather than berserk at your foe, you want to stay a tile or two seperate from them, and
pop into melee range unexpectedly to give them a quick stab before jumping back out. 

## Thrown weapons
There are three main types of throwing weapons. improvised, dedicated, and grenades. objects can be thrown after using the "throw" button, or after using the (default) hotkey "r".

### Improvised throwing weapons
Melee weapons (like swords) thrown at attackers and other items, such as floor tiles, fall into this category. The rapidity with which items can be thrown, plus the decent damge per throw,
means that thrown weapons can be unexpectedly deadly, even if makeshift. Particularly adventagous for improvised weapons is the plentitude of ammunition. Floor tiles make good
throwing weapons, as do chairs and fire extinguishers, and they are absolutely goddamn everywhere. This means that you can engage in ranged combat, even without
a dedicated ranged weapon, giving you the advantage over those using melee weapons.

### dedicated throwing weapons
Few of these exist, and the fact that they can be thrown back makes them a hard sell. They do not do enough to justify their low quanitity. if you have them, use them, but i
would advise against actively looking for them.

### Grenades
Grenades, on the other hand, absolutely justify their rarity. even ignoring chemistry, grenades can one shot people, force them to run, and, atop all this, can be "cooked"
To use a grenade, you must first activate it by clicking it in hand. at which point you will throw it at the next location you click (pressing R or the throw button will make you keep holding it, so dont touch them.)
When the grenade timer finishes, it will explode, greatly damaging players and objects in the blast.

## Notably useful tools/weapons/items.

-Tazers: stun for a short period, useful for getting into baton range
-Batons: stun for a very long period (unless they are the collapsable baton!), enough for handcuffs.
-Fire extinguishers: cover a large area in slippery water
-Flashs: blindness and stun
-handcuffs: see handcuffs under "various maladies"
-magboots: prevent slipping, but slow you down.
-banna peels/clown pda/similar items: slip when stepped on
-crowbar: not a very good weapon, source for floor tiles
-floor tiles: effective and super cheap throwing weapons.
-Lit welders, hatchets, toolboxes: effective and easy to acquire melee weapons

# Armour
Unlike weaponry, armour is rather simple, cutting damage by a certain percentage from certain sources.

## Vests, helmets, coats
Within unitystation, there are three main types of armour generally available to crew members. Bulletproof, standard, and riot gear. These come with matching helmets, and each
are good at dealing with specific types of damage. Bulletproof gear will dampen the damage dealt by bullets, but is bad against lasers, and garbage against melee weaponry. The opposite
is true of the riot armour, which excells against melee, but suffers against bullets. Standard vest offer an intermediary between the two. Other, rarer, items can offer similar protection.
for instance, the captains vest, HoS' coat, wardens vest, and the many aesthetic variants of the other vests all offer protection.

## Hardsuits
Dont be fooled by their looks, most hardsuits are a FAR worse choice than other armour when it comes to combat. Ignoring that (on the station) only the sec and captain suits have armour values anywhere comperable to a vest,
hardsuits slow you down greatly, meaning you are less able to escape or chase down others and more predictable. Their main usage is simply to let you go into space or breached regions to catch anyone in them.
The one exception is the hardsuits used by nuclear operatives, which do not slow down the wearer and have great armour values.

# Acquiring gear
All the gear in the world cant help you if you dont actually possess it. To this end there are many things you can do to acquire it. Following are some ideas.
- Buy/Bribe for it (it is a social game, after all)
- Utilize a favor or friend
- Acquire it through legitimate means (taking a tazer as [sec](Security Officer.md), for instance)
- stealing it with or without a disguise
- killing or mugging the person who has it
- other strategies that can be found in the [guide to access](Access.md)

# Fighting
Combat in unitystation is fundamentally based in knowledge, gear, and planning. Raw reflexive skill plays a part, but the victor in a fight is most often the one who strikes first and stacks
the most advantages while reducing those of the opponent, meaning it is almost always better to wait and prepare if you can, rather than rushing in. 

## Planning
A good plan is a great way of ensuring that you win a fight. If you go in prepared, equipped, and ready, against someone who is unaware or still plotting, you will have an enormous
advantage. Likewise, if someone ambushes or otherwise springs a plot against you, your best choice is to flee and plan your own defense. There are many things that can be considered while planning,
or when figuring things out on the fly, such as equipment, access, enviornment, relation, behaviour and your own skill.

### Equipment
While equipment itself is covered above, planning how to use it is another thing entirely. When planning, you should consider what you have onhand formost, such as stunning tools
or ways to access more hidden areas if you need to escape. If your plan require a specific item, it is often better to consider an alternate route than acquire the item if it poses a risk.

You should also take into account what your opponent has, if at all possible. If they are wearing riot armour for instance, bring a gun, if they have their own, wear a bulletproof vest.
Opponents without dedicated weapons or armour are easy prey, meaning if you can ambush them without equipment or get someone to remove theirs, it is worthwhile to attack even if you do not
have a set plan in mind.

### Access
something that is difficult to determine but very helpful to know is the access level of the person you are fighting as well as your own, and how they stack up. If you dont take this into account, you may end up setting up
ambushes that cant be tripped and run into areas they can still hunt you down in. Having higher amounts of access opens up easier access to equipment aswell as escape routes, while having low access oftentimes
limits you to open and exposed areas with little gear. 

If you are fighting someone with more access, it is best to stage an ambush, especilly in a region they feel safe, so that you can kill them before they can bring their equipment to bear
or escape.

On the flipside, when fighting someone with lower access, it is often more time-efficient to corral them into corners and chase them down, utilizing your superior access to use shortcuts and
close the gap. If they somehow manage to gain the upper hand, you can escape into a region they cannot enter.
