# The (Revised) Guide to Combat

## Introduction
Combat in Unitystation is both very complex and unique. While the base upon which it is built on is itself rather intricate, the myriad of interacting mechanics introduced by other systems
increases its complexity exponentially. This, aswell as the social element, lends itself well to making combat in unitystation more tactically unique.
Unfortunately (or fortunately?) this makes combat in unitystation very difficult to master. While this guide will by no means cover all the details (wed be here all week), it should
introduce and teach the core combat system, aswell as provide practical advice for combat and how to work towards a better understanding.

# Core systems
The very core of the combat system is a combination of parts of the intent and health systems. Intents are important to learn to interact with the combat system, and health is good
to know to reduce how often you die, and allow you to more effectively choose targets.

## Intents
There are 4 intents. Help, grab, disarm and harm

### Help (green)
Help intent, as implied by the name, is mainly used for non-combat interactions. It is still useful to know. If you on help intent, and not carrying a weapon in your hands, 
you cannot injure others, and will swap places/pass those you run into rather than stopping (good for chasing someone or being on the run). Using help intent on someone (including yourself) with medecine
in hand will apply the medecine to a selected body part, healing it (assuming you apply the correct meds).

### Grab (yellow)
Grab intent will grab the person you use it on. By moving, they can break out of your grab. When someone is grabbed, and not resisting, you can pull them, much the same as ctrl + click.
If someone is handcuffed, they will be unable to break out of your grab, letting you pull them into a prison cell if your merciful, or into a discrete location if your not.

### Disarm (blue)
Dont let the name fool you, disarm plays a far bigger role than just wrenching a weapon out of someones hands. If used on another player, they have a very good chance to drop their weapon, 
which you can then pick up, and possibly use (note, some guns are locked by id-based firing pins). If you absolutely must fight someone who is equipped, and are unarmed, DONT use the harm intent.
use the disarm intent and use their own weapons against them. This also works in reverse, dont get in melee range if you have a gun, as you will likely get disarmed and lit up with
your own gun. While you cant avoid getting in melee range if your using a melee weapon, you can minimize the risk of being disarmed by spending as little time in melee range as possible (in open combat)
and instead using Hit-and-Retreat methods, or by surprising/ambushing your foe to (hopefully) chop them up before they react.

Disarm doesnt stop there, though. Each individual disarm has a small chance to knock over the person being disarmed. While knocked down, people are stunned, and cannot shoot or melee back against attacks.
The time given by a disarm knockdown is NOT enough to handcuff people, dont make the mistake of coming close to an angry man with a gun with only one free hand of your own. When someone is knocked down, if
you are very quick, you can loot a few items from them. This can be anything on their person, from backpacks, to hidden guns, to their ID. If you plan on doing this to get your hands on a juicy ID or
traitor objective, be sure you know where they are probably located in the persons inventory. 

### Harm (red)
Harm intent, as is obvious from the name, is used to injure others with raw brute force. If you are on harm intent, you will attempt to hit those you click on in melee range (even if holding a gun!)
with the weapon in hand. Weapons can all still be used in other intents, and harm is mostly an intent there to make sure you dont accidentally help someone. While in harm, you wont be able
to apply medicine, help others up, etc. clicking someone while in harm intent with an empty hand will punch them, dealing a moderate amount of damage, but not enough to fight off a person who
has a proper weapon.

## The health system
In unitystation, health is much more complex than average. health can be decreased directly by 4 types of damage, two of which are applied to individual limbs. The total health is the base health, minus damage dealt to limbs,
and minus damage dealt by other causes. This means that enough damage to a single limb can kill, even if it is the only limb damaged. 

### Damage types
Brute damage is dealt by ballistic weapons, most melee weapons, and punches. It can be healed with bandages, and is applied to individual limbs. Burn damage is similarly applied to individual limbs. it can be
healed with ointment, and is dealt by lasers and fires. oxygen damage is caused by being in critical condition, or by a lack of air. It can be slowed with CPR (help intent on downed critical person) and is best healed
by getting somewhere one can breathe, or by healing to take a person out of a critical state. Toxin/poision damage is caused mainly by toxins, and is harder to heal than other damage types, requiring specific
chemicals to fix. 

### Limb targetting
On your hud, there is a small doll. when bodyparts are clicked, they will be targeted. this allows you to heal or injure specific regions. different parts have different chances to be successfully
hit (head is harder to hit than the torso for example). If an attack misses, it will most likely instead connect with another bodypart, only rarely will you whiff an attack entirely. The more injured you are,
the more likely you are to miss. These body parts will also be targeted when firing a gun.

## Various maladies
Especilly worthile to note are the many situational effects and objects that play large roles in combat.

### Stuns
Players can be stunned in several ways. Disarms can disable them for a short period, as can tazers, while stun batons can knock someone to the ground for a long enough period to arrest them.
It should be noted, again, that tazers and disarms will not give you enough time to fill the handcuff progress bar before the person your arresting gets back up. Stunned players can
be looted by dragging their sprite onto your own, as can handcuffed people.

### Handcuffs 
Handcuffs can be applied at any time, but require time to put on. This means you cant just approach a man with a knife and cuff him, not without disabling him first. one of the
few reliable methods to get this time is the stun baton, which can knock someone to the ground long enough to let you handcuff them. Those in cuffs cannot harm, punch, pick up objects,
or resist grabs, meaning they can be safely moved to a different location. Keep in mind they can still talk on the radio, unless you take that too.

### Blindness
While more rare, temporary blindness can be inflicted by flashbangs and portable flashes. While blind you can interact and run around, but cannot see. Frankly, blind people are incredibly
unpredictable, so blinding someone will probably make it harder, not easier, to land a stun on them.

# Weapons
There is a very large amount of weapons in unitystation, and learning which weapons are best for which jobs is good for maximizing effectiveness

## firearms
Most firearms shoot either lasers or bullets. Lasers can pass through windows and deal mainly burn damage, while guns deal brute damage.

### Lasers
Laser weapons only have a few set types of bolts, only two of which are very common. Tazer/electric bolts stun players on impact for a short period, disabler bolts stun them for
what is basically no time at all, "kill" lasers deal a moderate amount of burn damage, and disruptor bolts deal ridiculous amounts of damage capeable of melting walls. Laser and
energy based weapons like them must be charged at charging stations, with very few exceptions.

### bullets
There is a very large variety in ammunition in US, hell, almost every gun takes a different type of bullet. many of these bullets can also come in augmented forms, such as AP, hollow point,
incindiary, and more. Guns clips must be ejected when the gun is empty by clicking the gun in hand, and must be loaded by clicking on the gun while holding a magazine. Bullets are typically
more damaging than lasers, but the requirment of carrying around clips and lack of rapid adaptability means lasers still compete well.

### Fully automatic weapons
Full auto weapons, such as smgs and machine guns, will continue firing for as long as you hold down the mouse. While capeable of rapidly killing people, they burn through ammo equally
fast, and thus must be reloaded often. they are also rather inaccurate. Per-shot, they typically deal less damage than other weapons. They are great at mowing down single targets if you have plenty of down-time to reload
and prepare, and are great at killing those you are chasing, but struggle in more extended fights, when there is little opportunity to recover, and struggle at long range, forcing you close to danger.. 

### Semi automatic weapons
These fire once when you press the mouse button, are typically higher damage per shot, and are rather accurate. This means you can kill people without placing yourself in too much danger, and conserve
ammunition. semi-auto weapons that can fire with little cooldown are equally effective in ambushes as automatic weapons, but those with longer cooldowns (such as rifles and lasers) struggle to kill people before
they can flee. One exception to this is the sniper, which has a large cooldown but is great in ambushes, simply due to its massive damage per shot. Seni auto weapons cant mow people down
as fast as full auto weapons, but let you be safer and conserve ammunition.
