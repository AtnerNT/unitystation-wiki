Hiya! I'm Sergio, however, most people know me by Azzy, or a_heckin_canadian, my two online usernames. I'm fine with all 3, just make sure to call me 'heckin' instead of the entire name, as that gets a bit too long for most people to type out.


This is my page! I'm the SysOp of this wiki, but you can just call me the admin, along with [https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/User:Waffielz Waffielz], the other admin of this wiki. We, along with many other people from the [https://discord.gg/tFcTpBp Unitystation Discord], have <s>taken over this wiki by force</s> gained control of this wiki, and have come to Make Unitystation Wiki Great Again.

I didn't figure out the xenos maid in the kitchen was a cardboard cutout until well into second base.
