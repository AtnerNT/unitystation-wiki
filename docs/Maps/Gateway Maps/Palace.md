# Palace
The Palace is one of the possible teleporter destinations. It is currently unfinished and broken, but has some valuable ores and a few funny and unusual items to be found. There are a handful of surprisingly durable snakes lurking in the grassy corners, and one creature which mortal eyes were not meant to witness. The Palace has a very high amount of Bananium, making it worth the trip if the [Quartermaster](Quartermaster.md) needs cash. Otherwise, skip it.
