# Asteroid
Asteroids are randomly located chunks of rock scattered floating around the station. There are 5 asteroids at round start. Each asteroid has a set layout, but randomly generated ore and somewhat randomly generated threats; mostly lots of [|Xenomorphs.](Xenomorph.md) 


These rocks are where [miners](Shaft-miner.md) go to die.
