# Tunguska
"Viva La Tunguska" - The motto of the revolutionaries.

Tunguska is the official name of the station when a prohibition provoked revolution succeeds.

##  History =
On 20th of May, [REDACTED], \[Captain](Captain) Sebastian declared prohibition. Any and all \[alcohol](Bartending) was banned entirely, which changed the fact everyone wanted it, one Patrick Ironmonger was not afraid of the consequences and gave out whole bottles under the bar, and \[security](security) was oblivious to these dealing as the \[Head of Personnel](HoP) was giving the \[bartender](bartender) secret \[drink](Bartending) orders. Some time afterwards the gate opened to the \[Palace](Palace). \[Captain](Captain) assembled an expedition and departed into the unknown, perishing, and having his body never discovered. Patrick and the station \[mime](mime) took advantage of the situation and organized a revolution, after having captured \[security](security) sector with no resistance from the opposing side they went into the [[Ancient Temple]] looking for \[captain](captain)'s remains. None were found, but the second \[captain](captain) was found and captured at the bar. The aforementioned \[barman](Bartender) claimed \[captain](captain)'s ID and became the new leader, declaring the state of Tunguska. Shortly afterwards, when Patrick was cleaning up his bar the [[Chief Engineer]] asked for a private meeting, where he later murdered him, his motivation, still unknown.

##  Reason =
\[Alcohol](Bartending) is a universally known and acclaimed entertainment and relaxation method. As you can understand banning it, is not going to stop people from drinking it, whether they had/made their own, or bought it from the black market. The main difference between [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition 20s America] and \[Outpost](Outpost) Station, is the much lesser population, thus, organizing and maintaining a revolution was significantly easier, and the timing also came into play.

##  Prevention =
Don't declare prohibition. While yes - \[alcohol](Bartending) does cause [[Space Law|violence, accidents and such]], you cannot ban it out right. You must do it slowly and with compensation, if you are going to take away an entertainment method then you must replace it with something else, for example cannabis. And before you call me a madman, let's look at the statistics of crimes done under the influence of alcohol, and under the influence of cannabis.
|  | Alcohol | Cannabis |
 |----|----|----|
| Robberies | Sexual Assault | Assault |
| Homicide |
From this, we can see that it is better to 'gradually' ban \[alcohol](Bartending) and replace it with cannabis.
