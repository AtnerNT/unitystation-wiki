# Doobly
Doobly is the nick of the manager of UnityStation. He, like many other mayor game developers and corporation owners, is a living \[meme](Memes) in the sense that if something goes wrong with the launcher, it probably is his fault.

He is also the manager of the official UnityStation discord, and if I keep spamming the wiki on random channels he might outright ban me.
