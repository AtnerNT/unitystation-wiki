# PKA
The Proto Kinetic Accelerator is a beautiful hybridization of mining tool and gun. It has unlimited ammo, can be used for mining or EVA propulsion, and hits like a truck against unarmored targets, dealing 25 brute damage per shot. Its weaknesses include a slow rate of fire and a short range of 3 tiles. As a [Shaft Miner](Shaft-Miner.md), PKAs are your best defense against [Xenomorphs](Xenomorph.md) (other than, you know, an actual gun).

Mining typically begins with five in the locker room and a sixth in the [|QM's](Quartermaster.md) office locker. Two more come in the mining equipment crate purchaseable by the cargo console.
