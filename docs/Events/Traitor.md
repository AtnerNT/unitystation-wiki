**Role type:** <font color= "Red">[Antagonist](Antagonist.md)</font>. **Access:** Whatever your selected [Role](Roles.md) has. **Difficulty:**<font color="Yellow"> Medium</font>-<font color="Red">hard</font>.


## Overview

Traitor is one of the three types of Antagonist roles that can spawn, with the other two currently in the game being [Nuke Ops](Nuclear-Emergency.md) and [Cargonia](Cargonia.md).


### MISSION SPECIFICATION DECRYPTED. WELCOME, SYNDICATE AGENT.

As a Traitor, you spawn as the role you selected, with no visual distinction from everyone else. However, you are massively different from any other crew member: You're part of the [Syndicate](Groups.md). Maybe you're a hardcore follower of the Syndicate ways; maybe you're just some poor sap who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Either way, you have one job: [|Complete your objectives without giving away your true identity.](So-close-to-impossible-that-it-might-as-well-not-even-exist.md)

Traitors get 3 objectives, shown at the round start in the chat: Steal a random high-tier item, assassinate a random crew member (often a department head), and survive untill the end of the round. An example of what your objectives could be:

- Steal the Chain of Command (found in the captain's quarters)
- Assassinate Mr. Engineering man sir, [Chief Engineer](Chief-Engineer.md)
- Escape on the [Emergency Shuttle](Emergency-Shuttle.md) alive

At the moment, you get no special items as a Traitor. Instead, you have to make due with either what you're given from your job, or what you find lying around. Eventually however, once PDAs are added, you'll be able to order in some special toys.
